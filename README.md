# OrchestraDiscordBot

A DPP bot written in C++20.

Requirements: DPP, FFmpeg(I download these from VCPKG so you'd better do it too), yt-dlp.

To use bot set values in Resources/Resources.txt

Currently bot is only capable of playing music, which depends on yt-dlp. Also supports only one guild for playing music, so you cannot play music simultaneously on different guilds.
